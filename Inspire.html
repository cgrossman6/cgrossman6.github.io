        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes emobody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role model says a lot about who we are as people</p>
        <p>Jacob Thompsen is my hero because no matter what song is playing, he will always know who sings it. I wish I had as much music knoledge as him because he is absolutely incredible in that aspect</p>
