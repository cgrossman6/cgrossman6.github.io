        <h1>Amusing Videos</h1>
        <h3>by Carson Gross</h3>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite videos of all time.</p>

        <h2>Mets '86 Walkoff in Game 6</h2>
        <p>As a Mets fan, this is one of my all time videos because of the amazing come back the Mets displayed with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning. So many things had to go right for them to Win this game. The mets finsihed the job the next day and won the world series in game 7</p>
